            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi there! I'm Andreas, a 21-year-old IT enthusiast and consultant. My passion for technology started at a young age, and I've been captivated by the endless possibilities it offers ever since.</p>
            <p>I currently work as an IT consultant, where I get to dive into a variety of projects and challenges every day. From troubleshooting complex systems to designing efficient IT solutions, I thrive on making technology work seamlessly for everyone.</p>
            <p>One of my favorite hobbies is self-hosting. I run multiple servers and services from the comfort of my own home. Whether it's setting up a new web server, managing databases, or experimenting with different network configurations, I love getting hands-on with my setups.</p>
            <p>When I'm not tinkering with servers, you can find me exploring the latest in cybersecurity, automating tasks, or contributing to open-source projects. I'm always on the lookout for new technologies and trends to learn and incorporate into my skill set.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy walks, reading tech blogs, and occasionally dabbling in programming. I'm a big fan of creating a connected and smart home environment, utilizing my IT skills to make everyday life a bit more exciting and efficient.</p>
            <p>Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to connect with me through my social media links or check out my projects. Let's make technology fun and impactful together!</p>
